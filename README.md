## About
This project is primarily focused on the front end, built using React and TypeScript. Although I had intended to implement a proper backend, time constraints led me to use local storage for managing data. While this allows for basic local data storage and retrieval, a more robust backend solution would improve the project‚Äôs scalability and functionality.

Typically, for form handling in React, libraries like Formik are widely used to simplify the process. However, since this project only involves a simple form, I opted to build my own reusable form component that manages basic form state. While this approach works for the current scope, there‚Äôs room for significant improvement to make the form handling more complete and reliable for larger-scale applications.

I also intended to implement some nice-to-have features, such as those suggested in the case, like search and sort functionality. However, without a backend, these features felt somewhat redundant, as they would have limited utility in a local storage setup. Additionally, time constraints prevented me from fully exploring these enhancements.
